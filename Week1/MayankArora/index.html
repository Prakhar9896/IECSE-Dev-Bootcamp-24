    <h1>Mayank Arora</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I am Mayank Arora, currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science and Finance from MIT Manipal batch of '28. Driven by my passion, my interests lie towards financial knowledge, and computer science. Web Development being something i <em>tried</em> to explore before the start of my course, therefore i believe it does align with my interests. I am also inclined towards learning about app development and GUI implementation using c++, although i have <strong>NOT</strong> found a resource to learn it from.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I have many hobbies, I really love swimming, typing, and talking in general. A weirdly wide spectrum of things i like to do, but that's just who i am.
        A keyboard enthusiast, infact im typing this just to listen to the sound of typing.
